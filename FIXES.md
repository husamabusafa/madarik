# Fixes Applied

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. Prisma Client Generation Error
**Problem**: TypeScript errors showing missing exports from `@prisma/client`
```
Module '"@prisma/client"' has no exported member 'User'
Module '"@prisma/client"' has no exported member 'Locale'
```

**Solution**: Generated the Prisma client
```bash
pnpm prisma:generate
```

**Result**: All TypeScript types are now available and the server builds successfully.

### 2. Client Port Configuration
**Problem**: Vite was starting on port 5173 instead of the expected port 5100

**Solution**: Updated `client/vite.config.ts` to specify port 5100
```typescript
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    port: 5100,
    host: true,
  },
})
```

**Result**: Client now starts on http://localhost:5100 as expected.

## 🚀 Current Status

### ✅ Working Components
- **Prisma Client**: Generated and working
- **Server Build**: Compiles successfully
- **TypeScript Types**: All imports resolved
- **Monorepo Setup**: pnpm workspace configured
- **Development Command**: `pnpm dev` starts both services

### 🌐 Service Endpoints
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5100
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:3100
- **GraphQL Playground**: http://localhost:3100/graphql

### 📋 Next Steps for Full Setup

1. **Database Setup** (Required before running):
   ```bash
   # Update server/.env with your PostgreSQL URL
   pnpm prisma:migrate
   pnpm prisma:seed
   ```

2. **Start Development**:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
pnpm dev              # Start both client and server
```

### Database Operations
```bash
pnpm prisma:studio    # View database in browser
pnpm prisma:migrate   # Apply schema changes
pnpm prisma:seed      # Add initial data
```

### Building
```bash
pnpm build            # Build both projects
```

## ✨ All Systems Ready!

The development environment is now fully configured and ready for development. Both the React frontend and NestJS backend will start simultaneously with proper TypeScript support and all dependencies resolved.

**Happy coding! 🚀**
